# Saucer project

The purpose of the saucer project is to create bidirectional interop between the R programming language and D, and to provide a D API to the standalone Rmath library. The aim is that it will be competitive with the RCpp library in terms of its features and capability but with the added advantage that the D programming language is far more accessible than C++, but also has very powerful set of programming paradigms influenced by C, C++, Java, and languages in the functional sphere, retaining easy to use metaprogramming tools, bundling, unit testing and a package manager and many other very useful features. For more information see the [D programming language website](https://dlang.org/).
