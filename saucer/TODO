# TODO


## Implementation

1. Do a proper re-write of RVector, RMatrix types to account for protect/unprotect errors. Also re-address the way that you deal with
   stirngs because they cause the most problems.

2. Add testing function for D compilation into the R package to run tests on D's unittest blocks. DONE, but will need to be updated when the compiler/flag options are created.

3. Add pass compilation flags and compiler options to compiler function in R

4. Things to implement on the D side:
    - Environments
    - Functions - see how to also eval these in D
    - Multidimensional arrays > 2D

5. Multiple OS support  for Windows and Mac

6. Compiling multiple files and modules

7. Adding debug mode compilation option.


## Testing

1. Complete unittests on both the R and D side.
2. Memory tests valgrind
3. Performance testing.
