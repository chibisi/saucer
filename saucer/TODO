# TODO


## Implementation

1. Solve the stack (un/protect) issues resulting from character and list/data frame by doing separate implementations of STRSXP (Character stuff) and VECSXP for list and data frames (separately)

2. Add testing function for D compilation into the R package to run tests on D's unittest blocks. Done, but will need to be updated when the compiler/flag options are created.

3. Add pass compilation flags and compiler options to compiler function in R

4. Things to implement on the D side:
    - Environments
    - Functions - see how to also eval these in D
    - Multidimensional arrays > 2D

5. Multiple OS support  for Windows and Mac

6. Compiling multiple files and modules


## Testing

1. Complete unittests (on the D side)
2. Memory tests valgrind
3. Performance testing.
