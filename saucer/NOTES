# Notes


1. When calling `writeln`, use the `toString()` function on RVector, RMatrix and other D-interfacing object. This is because `writeln` currently calls copy constructors multiple times which is obviously resource wasteful. For convenience I don't really want to disable it.

2. Users need Rmath library installed: https://openwetware.org/wiki/Installing_libRmath
```
sudo apt install r-mathlib
```
